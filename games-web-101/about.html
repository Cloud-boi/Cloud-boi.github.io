        <button onclick="window.location.href='home.html';" class="back-home-button">Home</button>
        <p>I made this website mostly to learn how to code html, CSS, and javascript (but I already knew a lot of javascript).
            You can play games on this site, obviously.
            It was a ton of fun making it, and I hope you have fun playing the embedded games.</p>
        <p>By the way, there are no like cookies or anything so uh ya.</p>
