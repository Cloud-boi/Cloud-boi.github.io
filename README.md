# GamesWeb101
I made this website mostly to learn how to code html, CSS, and javascript (but I already knew a lot of javascript). You can play games on this site, obviously. It was a ton of fun making it, and I hope you have fun playing the embedded games.

Go to Cloud-boi.github.io to actually access the website.
